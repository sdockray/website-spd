# Studies

Studies are focused investigations that take diverse material forms—from essays and software to sculptures, performances, and recorded works—each pursuing distinct lines of inquiry through research-based practice. These works often exist in multiple iterations or drafts, following an experimental approach that treats each medium as a method of thinking. Whether taking their shape as installations, writings, or sound pieces, each study represents a committed exploration of particular questions, concepts, or phenomena encountered through sustained engagement with specific materials and histories.
