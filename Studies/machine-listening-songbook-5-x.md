_Machine Listening Songbook: Songs About Fucking Suno,_ 2024 Audio, audio-video, essay and live performance.

Researched, written and produced: Sean Dockray, James Parker, and Joel Stern. Voices: cloned using ElevenLabs. Instrument design: Sean Dockray.

Live performers: Jennifer Walshe and Tomomi Adachi. Videos: Emile Zile.

The songbook is a media technology. Like all songbooks, this one is open-ended. It will keep growing. The first four entries were produced during our [residency](https://www.unsound.pl/en/dada/machine-listening-residency) at Unsound 2023, in response to the festivalâ€™s theme: [Dada/Data](https://www.notion.so/Machine-Listening-Songbook-Dada-Data-96fdfc7c175a4df8944b9b82aaa0a99d?pvs=21).

The latest iteration, Songs About Fucking Suno, was originally commissioned by [SOFT CENTRE](https://www.softcentre.com.au) for performance in a library, and eventually realised at the Victorian Trades Hall with improvised vocals from the incredible [Jennifer Walshe](http://milker.org) and [Tomomi Adachi](https://www.adachitomomi.com) on 29 August 2025.
