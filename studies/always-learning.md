## Description

*Always Learning* stages an increasingly reflexive conversation between three devices – an Amazon Echo, a Google Home Assistant, and an Apple Homepod – and invites us to consider the possible philo­soph­i­cal, moral and polit­i­cal implications of autonomic computing, the rise of voice operation and our increasing comfort levels with devices that listen by default. Electronic personal assistants are just the kindergarten for a vast corporate listening apparatus – an algorithmic ‘panacousticon’ – the effects of which we should not expect to be benign.

This work was commissioned for [Eavesdropping](https://eavesdropping.exposed/events/alwayslearning), a project curated by James Parker and Joel Stern at Ian Potter Museum of Art, Melbourne Australia.
