## Survey

>Many of the policies, institutions, and organizational forms that are today seen as the infrastructure of Australian art were originated in the 1960s and 1970s. At that time, the median price of buying a house in Melbourne was $12,800 and the average weekly wage was about $75. Renters spent about 1/10 of their income on housing. Our intuition, experience, and conversations have told us that things are very, very different now.  
  
>*The Real Estate Survey* attempts to quantify the effect of the real estate market on today's arts ecosystem by specifically looking at the percentage of income that is absorbed by the real estate market from both individuals and organizations in the arts. We want to use the results of the survey to initiate a conversation about real estate, finance, and art, asking whether our inherited policies, institutions, and organizational forms are adequate to our present reality.

The survey was done through [a Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFrFXjDnF27S4tt4OoKyV1E02y5bSMkeOOIq-uKSyrAr613w/viewform?c=0&w=1)
