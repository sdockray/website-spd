# Studies

## Overview

Studies are focused investigations that take diverse material forms—from essays and software to sculptures, performances, and recorded works—each accumulating through research-based practice. These works often exist in multiple iterations or drafts, following an experimental approach that treats its medium as a method of thinking. Whether taking their shape as installations, writings, or sound pieces, each study represents a committed, speculative exploration of particular questions, concepts, or phenomena encountered through engagement with specific materials and histories. They are listed 7 year cycles.
