## Description

In 2015-2016 I made a custom GitLab installation that would host syllabi called _Syllabus Hub_. It was a bit more 'opinionated' in its structure than a collection on [[quasi-institutions/aaaarg-org|AAAARG.ORG]] (although it was just Markdown). I was thinking a lot about how a syllabus was a kind of programmatic form, a score for collective study, and in this way the manifesto of the 21st century. It is often political, it requires action, and produces new subjectivities. The energy of this project was eventually diverted into [[quasi-institutions/hyperreadings|HyperReadings]].
