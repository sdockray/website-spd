## Description

“_Imagine a computer made of humans. Imagine this computer as a new kind of theatre. Listen_.”

Data is never mined. It is always made. A computational theatre. Many datasets are literally performed by actors, or researchers pretending to be actors. Others are the product of our own performances for and with machines, every time we ‘wake up’ Alexa or upload a video to YouTube.

_After Words_ explores these dynamics across a series of speculative scenes. Each scene works with readymade audio, repurposed from machine learning datasets, and woven through a script written with and against an ‘autoregressive language model’. The result is a strange set of semi-fictional tales of computational scripting, instruction, production, and performance, staged in 8-channel audio. In this strangeness, _After Words_ gestures at a near future in which language has been fully operationalised: where every word we speak has a computational effect and residue.

Researched, written and produced: Sean Dockray, James Parker, Joel Stern. Voices: Mark Andrejevic, Sean Dockray, Jake Goldenfein, Roslyn Orlando, James Parker, Thao Phan, Joel Stern. Design: Stuart Geddes.
