## Abstract

Performing Algorithms: Automation and Accident investigates how artists might 
stage encounters with the algorithms driving our post-industrial, big-data-based, 
automatic society. Several important theories of this contemporary condition are 
discussed, including control societies, post-industrial societies, the automatic 
society, the cybernetic hypothesis, and algorithmic governmentality. These 
concepts are interwoven with histories of labour and automation, recent 
developments in machine learning and neural networks, and my own past work. 

Through a series of expanded lecture performances that describe our algorithmic 
condition while setting it into motion, this research seeks to discover ways in which 
to advance new critical positions within a totalizing technical apparatus whose very 
design preempts it. The included creative works have been performed, exhibited, 
and published between 2014 and 2018. They are made available online through an 
artificially intelligent chatbot, a frequent figure in the research, which here extends 
the concerns of that research through to how the work is framed and presented. 

The thesis focuses on both generative art and the lecture performance, which 
converge in performing algorithms but are generally not discussed in connection 
with one another. They emerged in parallel as artistic methods, however, at a time 
when management and computation were taking root in the workplace in the 
1960s. Furthermore, as the Internet became widespread from the 1990s, 
generative art and the lecture performance each found renewed prominence. 

With human language and gesture increasingly modelling itself on the language of 
computation and work constantly reshaped by the innovations of capital, this 
project identifies “not working” both in terms of the technological breakdown and 
also as a condition of labour under automation. A discussion of the first fatal 
accident involving a self-driving vehicle illustrates this dual condition. Shifting from 
glitch art’s preoccupation with provoking errors to a consideration of not working, 
this research proposes artistic strategies that learn to occupy rather than display 
the accident.
