## Overview

This short video appropriates the duration, format, and footage of the contemporary real estate walkthrough video. All of the footage–taken from advertisements and marketing–is authentic and suffocatingly vacant, malevolent, inhuman. The upbeat or tasteful music is replaced with tense soundtrack music from the movie _Gravity_ and clips were interspersed with a story extracted from the news about a woman who died in her garage and wasn't discovered for months. It was installed in the front window of the gallery in the common display vocabulary of the real estate agent shopfront.
