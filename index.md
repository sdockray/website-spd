This website is an archive of art, writing, and cultural production of Sean Dockray[^1] and collaborations since 1999. There are two main categories: [[studies/index|Studies]], which are objects (like essays, videos, performances, installations) materializing some research; and [[quasi-institutions/index|Quasi-institutions]], or longer-term projects that generate studies, usually operating on a 1:1 scale in the world. 

For the past few years, I have been completely focused on [[quasi-institutions/machine-listening|Machine Listening]], an ongoing project with James Parker and Joel Stern. One of the most fun things about it is that it's a context where we can make installations, essays, music, software, and whatever makes sense for the discussions we are having. Recently, we've done a radio commission for Cashmere Radio / Deutschlandfunk Kultur, an installation about a dataset of falls ([[studies/55-falls-ambient-assisted-living|55 Falls / Ambient Assisted Living]]), released a record based on a previous installation ([[studies/environments-12|Environments 12]]), and put out a streaming album/ critique of the generative culture industry ([[studies/songs-about-fucking-suno|Songs About Fucking Suno]]).

This is Tamago. We found her living under the place we are living in.
