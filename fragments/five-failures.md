### RELIABLE ACCESS


- early principles: as open & available as possible
- passwords, dead links (file, media fire)
- becoming what you oppose
- library with things missing :(
- choices: secret but accessible / open but precarious

---
### ALWAYS REACTIVE


- not really a failure, but feels like one
- contours of library respond to what users upload or request
- design adjusts to use
- C&D
- iterative design - negotiation v. vision
- formless, might turn into anything. anything?

### CENTRALIZATION


- hackers, file-sharers, and common sense agree...
- centralization of responsibility
- throwback to original (obsolete) WWW
- technical v. organizational decentralization


---


### GROWING BADLY


- iterative growth (scalability)
- metadata, full text searching
- redundant files
- but allow multiplicity
- too many issues


---



### MORE AND MORE DEBT


- how are authors paid? publishers? translators?
- what are economics of publishing (esp. with cloud)
- is the site engaged or not in this question?
- can mechanisms of publishing be industrialized? milieu?
- value creation, selection
- alternatives to milking readers

### NO POLITICAL POWER


- 90,000 people and 7 years
- people seeing eachother
- shifting from place to place 'underground' - its destiny?
- complacency
