## On glaciers

These projects operate as long-term frameworks (for community building, research, collaboration, knowledge production) that extend beyond traditional artistic boundaries. Each functions as both a container and generator—hosting other projects, facilitating exchanges between practitioners, or creating infrastructures for sustained inquiry across multiple disciplines and communities. Rather than discrete works, they represent evolving platforms that accumulate meaning and complexity through ongoing engagement and use.
