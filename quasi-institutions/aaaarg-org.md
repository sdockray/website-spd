AAAARG.ORG was an online repository of scans, exports, essays, excerpts, books, and other marginalia. It was an online platform supporting offline autodidactic activities. AAAARG.ORG grew into a community of researchers and enthusiasts from contemporary art, critical theory, philosophy, and related fields who maintain, catalog, annotate and run discussions relevant to their research interests. Its self-description:

> AAAARG.ORG is a conversation platform - at different times it performs as a school, or a reading group, or a journal. It was created with the intention of developing critical discourse outside of an institutional framework. But rather than thinking of it like a new building, imagine scaffolding that attaches onto existing buildings and creates new architectures between them.

## History

To be written.

## Features

Robert Ochshorn and I implemented this reading interface through which you could search, highlight, add annotations, and excerpt into a commonplace book. Multiple people could remotely "read together" occupying the space of a page in real time while chatting and doing all of the above.

Searching for "struggle" within the book. Densities of the term's appearance in the book are clear from the highlighting.

Multiple search terms at the same time: "vote" and "strike", intersections are apparent from the highlights.

The reading interface is a window scanning the surface of the pages ("vote" and "strike" both appear on this page):

The window into the book, where a translator's note has been highlighted:

![[attachments/reader-3.jpeg]]

Here this translator's note has been "clipped" and a note and some tags can be added as well. The clip can just be shared as an image, it can be shared as a link to the precise location in the book, and it can also be added into the reader's commonplace book.

A second reading interface allowed for linking to a text from within the page of another text. Here the grid of pages is more vertical to provide space for other texts to be added onto the right.

The colorful marks are links that readers have embedded into the page of this article.

Clicking one links directly to the location of the relevant passage in another text. This chain of references can continue on.

The global search also gave results as pages

And clicking on a page would bring you directly into that same page.
