## Bio
Sean Dockray develops systems and studies that investigate the politics of technology, with particular attention to artificial intelligence and the infrastructures of knowledge sharing. His practice operates across research, writing, software development, and collaborative platforms, often manifesting as long-term frameworks that host and generate other projects, communities, and forms of inquiry.

Dockray's systems include Machine Listening Curriculum (co-founded with James Parker and Joel Stern in 2020), a critical platform for research and artistic experimentation focused on AI-based listening; knowledge-sharing platforms The Public School and AAAARG.ORG; and the Los Angeles non-profit Telic Arts Exchange, where he served as a founding director. His studies take diverse forms—from installations and lecture performances to essays, software projects, and neural networks—each pursuing distinct lines of investigation through sustained engagement with particular technologies, concepts, or phenomena.

Recent exhibitions and presentations include Data Relations at ACCA, Melbourne (2022); House of Mirrors: Artificial Intelligence as Phantasm at HKMV, Dortmund (2022); and performances such as "Hack Piece" and "Listening to the Diagnostic Ear." His written work appears in publications including Artlink, Frieze, Cabinet, and Volume, addressing topics from artificial intelligence and online education to infrastructure and automation.

His practice-led PhD at the University of Melbourne, *Performing Algorithms: Automation and Accident* developed an expanded notion of the essay form to explore how artists might stage encounters with algorithmic systems.
