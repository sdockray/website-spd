### Machine Listening

Since 2020, I have spent most of my time on the [Machine Listening]() project with James Parker and Joel Stern. This has included research, [writing](https://machinelistening.exposed/texts), and [artworks](https://machinelistening.exposed/works), an online [curriculum](https://machinelistening.exposed/curriculum),  [interview series](https://machinelistening.exposed/interviews), numerous on-and-offline [events, lectures, performances](https://machinelistening.exposed/curation), and the development of assisted listening and composition tools, including an [instrument](https://machinelistening.exposed/word-processor).

Back in 2018, Joel and James commissioned an artwork for an exhibition they were planning called [Eavesdropping](https://eavesdropping.exposed/) and I ended up producing an installation, *Always Learning* and a video, *Learning from YouTube*.
